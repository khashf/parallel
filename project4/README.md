### New agent: Wolfs

* More wolfs are born only when there are more than 1 wolf in the pack.

* There is 25% chance a new wolf is born from a pair of wolfs

* The percentage of chance that the wolf pack attack the deers is propotional to the number of wolfs and the number of deers

* In the event of wolf-attack, the bigger the value of grain height, the less deers are killed because as higher grain, deers can get away from wolf due to lack of sight. Also, the more there are wolfs in the attack, the more grain will be storm down during the chase. If there are no wolf-attack in a month, a quarter of population will die that month

* The wolfs only come in stage 2, at the end of the month, when the grain has grown and the deers have been well fed (when both values are updated)

* 2 wolf eat 1 deer. If there are more deers than the required numbers, it's fine, but if there are not enough deers for all the wolf, the wolf population will decrease by (required deers - actual deers)/2
