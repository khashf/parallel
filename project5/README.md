## How to...
### Compile
1. Source the necessary environment variables and settings. See [Intel's getting started guide](file:///opt/intel/documentation_2018/en/compiler_c/ps2018/get_started_lc.htm). In my computer, it's
```
source /opt/intel/parallel_studio_xe_2018/bin/psxevars.sh 
```
2. Make sure you now can run Intel C++ compiler
```
icpc -help
```
